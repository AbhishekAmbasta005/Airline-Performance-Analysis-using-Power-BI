# ✈️ Airline Performance Analysis using Power BI

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Airline Performance Analysis** project focuses on evaluating key operational and customer performance metrics in the airline industry.  
The analysis was conducted using **Power BI**, with end-to-end data transformation, modeling, and visualization to provide actionable insights for flight management and customer experience improvement.

---

## 🧩 Objectives
- Assess airline performance across multiple KPIs such as passenger bookings, ticket statuses, and flight punctuality.  
- Build a clean and reliable dataset for analytics using Power Query.  
- Develop interactive and insightful dashboards for business decision-making.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Microsoft Power BI**
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Creation of custom measures and KPIs  
- **Excel / CSV Data Sources**  
- **Power BI Service** (for dashboard publishing and interactivity)

## 📊 Key Steps and Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaned and standardized raw airline data using Power Query.  
   - Removed duplicates, fixed data types, and handled missing values.  

2. **Data Modeling**  
   - Established relationships between datasets (Bookings, Flights, Passengers).  
   - Applied cardinality and cross-filtering logic for accurate calculations.  

3. **DAX Calculations**  
   - Created DAX measures for:
     - Total Bookings  
     - Cancellation Rate  
     - On-Time Performance %  
     - Revenue and Occupancy Metrics  

4. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Designed interactive visuals to explore flight trends and customer insights.  
   - Configured **slicers, drill-throughs, and filters** for dynamic reporting.  
   - Ensured all visuals align with KPIs for real-time monitoring.

## 📈 Insights and Findings
- Identified routes and time periods with the highest booking volumes.  
- Revealed that delayed flights significantly impacted customer satisfaction scores.  
- Found correlation between flight occupancy rates and ticket revenue trends.  
- Provided actionable insights for optimizing scheduling and pricing strategies.
